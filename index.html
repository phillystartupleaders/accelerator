      <h2>What is it?</h2>
      <p>The PSL Accelerator is a 12 week program that empowers Philly’s promising founders and early-stage startups to realize their vision. Each week, we guide local startups through the tough transition between business development and sales. We arm entrepreneurs with the knowledge, tools, and mentors they need to keep improving their business, while providing a safe environment where they can fail, pivot, and struggle through growing pains. Our mission is to develop talented local entrepreneurs which in turn will help to grow a robust and thriving tech community in Philadelphia.</p>
      <h2>Who is it for?</h2>
      <p>A fast track for local Philadelphia startups focused on moving forward with an MVP, and making their first few crucial sales. You will be matched with strategic mentors, attend bi weekly sessions led by some of Philly tech's brightest, set goals and track metrics throughout. The program will ultimately end with Demo Day where the companies will pitch to over 150 investors and community members.</p>
      <h2>What will you get out of it?</h2>
      <p>The PSL Accelerator helps Philly’s founders and early-stage startups to overcome obstacles and push forward towards tangible progress. We do not take equity; we provide value through weekly sessions with mentorship from local leaders, support from a cohort of peers and the PSL community, connections to additional resources and advisors and idea launching support.</p>

      <blockquote>
        "I loved participating in the Accelerator. It was just a really awesome group of founders and mentors working together. Perhaps more importantly, mentorship from the PSL team and some of the speakers made a measurable and significant impact on Borderwise's bottom line."
        <cite>Jeremy Peskin, CEO of Borderwise</cite>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "The previous Fishbox pricing model wasn't working. Because my mentor had experience with the same issue at his current company, he recommended a change that simplified things. That update led to a 20% increase in MRR."
        <cite>Napoleon Suarez, CEO of Fishbox</cite>
      </blockquote>


      <blockquote>
        "We came into the program as normal college students with an idea and an MVP. The 3 months of the Accelerator transformed us! We managed to launch our product half way through the Accelerator, we got the opportunity to speak with a bunch of investors where we received strategic insights, and more importantly we made lifelong connections with the rest of the Accelerator companies!
        <cite>Danish Dhamani, CEO of Orai"</cite>
      </blockquote>

      <blockquote>
        The PSL Accelerator was and will continue to be one of the greatest catalysts of our organization's growth. The in-depth exposure to local and far-reaching entrepreneurs and financiers offered perspective, encouragement, and best approaches. We're thrilled for what's now ahead.
        <cite>Mark Switaj, CEO of Roundtrip</cite>
