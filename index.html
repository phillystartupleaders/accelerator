      <h2>About the PSL Accelerator</h2>
      <h3>What is it?</h3>
      <p>The PSL Accelerator is a 12 week program that empowers Philly's promising founders and early-stage startups to realize their vision. Each week, we guide local startups through the tough transition between business development and sales. We arm entrepreneurs with the knowledge, tools, and mentors they need to keep improving their business, while providing a safe environment where they can fail, pivot, and struggle through growing pains. Our mission is to develop talented local entrepreneurs which in turn will help to grow a robust and thriving tech community in Philadelphia.</p>
      <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
      <p>This program is a fast track for local Philadelphia startups focused on moving forward with an MVP, identifying product market fit and making their first crucial sales. This program is ideal for full time founders who plan on rooting themselves in Philadelphia and building their company here long term.</p>
      <h3>What will you get out of it?</h3>
      <p>We provide value through weekly sessions from local leaders, support from a cohort of peers and connections to additional community resources. You will be matched with strategic mentors, attend sessions led by some of Philly tech's brightest, set goals and track metrics throughout. The program will ultimately end with Demo Day where the companies will pitch to 150+ investors and community members.</p>
